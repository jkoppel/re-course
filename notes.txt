Plan:

0) Offer handouts (x86 cheat sheet + IDA cheat sheet), ask to sign in, point to URL and ask them to set up IDA + download crackmes
1) Introduce instructors. "Reverse engineering is awesome"
2) Assembly crash course
3) Open crackme0. Run it. Explain our goal to make it let us in. Talk about figuring out what it does. Show patching it to let us in.
4) Declare a time when they'll be interrupted for Project Ironfist demo + a video
5) Explain what Bomb Lab is, and how it inspired crackme1. Let them loose to begin figuring out crackme1.
6) Instructors walk around and help students
7) Midway through, interrupt, show Hackers video, demo Project Ironfist and how the modding works
8) Resume 5/6

People who finish early: Can offer WinMine as a more interesting program to reverse, or crackmes.cf

How to teach assembly crash course:

Give examples of everything. Use IDA debugger; show changing registers/memory as you run each line

1) Registers (mov, add, sub, ...)
2) Memory dereferences
3) Stack (push, call, ret, ebp, esp)
4) Control flow (flags [show changing after each instruction], cmp/test, jg/jge/jmp)

This is a good place to split up work among instructors.

Notes on demo'ing crackme0:

* The Windows version of crackme0 has debug symbols in a separate file, which we don't distribute. Not having debug symbols is a blessing in disguise; gives a chance to show off searching for strings and using cross-references.

Todos:

*) Add pseudocode for ops to x86 cheat sheet
*) Make slides with a single image for Apptimize (espionage) and IBM PC (compatibility) stories
*) Add a place just to talk about the understanding that comes with RE (+ ability to cut through layers of abstraction and debug the hardest bugs)
*) Find the other clip from Hackers, where "Plague" talks about commonly used passwords
*) Find good Mac/Linux crackmes for anyone who finishes early
*) Fix errant AT&T syntax in the second footnote of the cheatsheet
